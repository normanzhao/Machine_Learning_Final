# Machine_Learning_Final
We used Keras to build a simple 2 layer neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The network was trained using the 70000 MNIST digits we used in a previous SVM lab. We used Tkinter to build a UI to for user to draw digits and used the trained Keras model to predict the digits being drawn. The predicted accuracy is near 98%, but the actual accuracy seems to be near 60%. We are currently wokring on implementing letters into it.
